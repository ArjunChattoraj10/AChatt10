## What is this?

This is a simple python program to make a random name generator.
Unlike typical name generators, which have a database, or some list of existing names, and simply prints out a random name from this list,
this program does randomly choose the letters for the name based on some user preferences.

## Specifics about this program

When the program is run, the computer starts by prompting the user for a length for the name,
and then for an input for a type of letter, or a specific letter. 
However, if some nonsense input is fed in, the user may be greeted with a sarcastic comment.

The only problem with program is that quite often it can result in some nonsense names like qdggcx. 
It was still a fun little challenge to undertake. 
Dealing with the different types of nonsense inputs was the main hurdle, but it was still all fun.
