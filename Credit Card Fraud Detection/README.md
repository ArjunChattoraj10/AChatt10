## What is this?

This is an attempt to build a model using the dataset found on *Credit Card Fraud Detection*, found on **Kaggle**.

## The file

My analysis and model are found in the file named *Stock Prediction*. 
This file is an *R Markdown* file, because it an elegant way of presenting R code.
The knitted *HTML* file is also included.

## Datasets

The datasets used in this file are not uploaded to my *Github* repository as it is too large. 
The datasets may be obtained from Kaggle, at the competitions website.

The competition is called: *Credit Card Fraud Detection*, and the dataset is called *creditcard.csv*

The URL is: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
