# README

## What is this?

This is a document to help utilize and improve on my data visualization techniques.
There is also an attempt at clustering provided in the document.

## The file

My code and visualizations are found in the file named *school.Rmd*.
This file is an *R Markdown* file, because it an elegant way of presenting R code.
The knitted *HTML* file is also included.

## The datasets

The main dataset used is the **2016 School Explorer.csv** dataset.
Additionally there is a **D5 SHSAT Registration and Testers** dataset, 
although it wasn't used in my dataset.

All of these datasets can be found on *Kaggle*, from **PASSNYC**.
The dataset page is called:
*PASSNYC: Data Science for Good Challenge* and the link for it is:
https://www.kaggle.com/passnyc/data-science-for-good

The *2016 School Explorer* dataset contains details about many different schools 
in and around New York City. Details include 
Income, Economic Need Index, Ethnicity percentages, Grade-wise statistics, and many more.

## Outcome

The challenge that *PASSNYC* had provided was to identify which schools were more in need.
However, the data that was provided was also idea to explore and hone visualization techniques.
Although I didn't do anything overly complicated, one of the techniques I used involved using a map to convey school-wise information,
because of latitude and longitude data that was provided.
It was also good exploring the different applications of the packages *ggplot2* and *plotly*, 
and allowed me to become more comfortable with them.
I also used the data to attempt clustering, which was a fun exploration.

This document can now serve as a reference for me when I need to perform visualization and clustering in the future.

## Acknowledgements

All packages used were downloaded off *CRAN* and *Github*, 
and are noted in a code chunk at the top of my *R Markdown* document.
The sources of the *Github* packages as well as the exact code used to download them 
are present in comments in the same code chunk.
Inspiration for some of the visualizations and the clustering comes from the kernel of user Faraz Rahman,
which can be found on *Kaggle*.
