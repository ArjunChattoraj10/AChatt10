# AChatt10 -- Readme

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to **Arjun Chattoraj**'s repository -- named *AChatt10*. 
In this repository, you are likely to find files of projects that I am currently working on or have finished working on.

## Who am I?
I am a third year undergraduate student at **Cornell University**,
pursuing a major in *Biometry and Statistics* and a minor in *Computer Science*.

During the summer of 2018, I worked as an intern at **TCG Digital**. 
Using R and RStudio, I performed Churn Modeling and Market Basket Analysis on financial datasets.

I am currently working as a **Teaching Assistant** for the course *BTRY 3010 - Biological Statistics I*. 
I lead labs, in which I guide students through R and RStudio and reinforce statistical concepts learned during lecture.
I also hold weekly office hours to ensure students gain a complete understanding of the material.

## What kind of files will be here?
Since I am a statistics student, many of these files will be regarding data analysis and machine learning.
Hence, the most popular coding languages you'd find here are *Python* and *R*.

Many of the *R* files will be as an *R Markdown* file. 
*R Markdown* is a very clean and elegant way of presenting *R* code alongside text, 
so it makes sense to make full use of it.

Apart from statistical code, there may also be non-statistical projects. 
These projects will typically be fun in nature, and I am likely to have undertaken them because they are interesting.
These projects are likely to be based in either *Python* or *Java*.

## Concluding words

Please feel free to look around. 
Some projects may not be finished, but nothing present in this repository has not been given a sincere effort.
