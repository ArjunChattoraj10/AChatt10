The basic plan to start any data analysis project:

1. Find names of columns and how many rows
2. Use summary() to find descriptive statistics of each row. This will also reveal the number of missing values you have.
3. Impute missing values
	- Make a new category for categorical variables
	- Replace with mean for continuous ones
	- Replace with min-1 for discrete ones
4. Make a baseline model. This should be simple. Examples:
	- Repeating the most common value
	- Guessing for discrete variables based on proportion of responses
	- Plot the mean.
5. Make a slightly less simple model. Make it a linear regression.
6. Start building more complex models. 
	- Logistic Regression
	- Decision Trees
	- XGB Boost
7. Start fine-tuning. Use data visualization.
