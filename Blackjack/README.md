## What is this?

This is a simple game of blackjack implemented using Python.

The user should run the **blackjack.py** file in order to play the game.
The *card.py* file contains information regarding the cards and the deck.

When the user runs *blackjack.py*, the user is presented by the his or her hand and the dealer's hand.
If the user wishes to draw another card or stop, he or she can follow the instructions printed on their screen.

## Rules

You are dealt 2 cards, and the dealer has one card.

You can draw cards as long as the sum of the cards is not over 21.

When you stop, the dealer draws.

The one with the *highest score* wins.

However, if one of your draws takes your total over 21, you lose. The same applies to the dealer.
