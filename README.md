# AChatt10 -- Readme

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to **Arjun Chattoraj**'s repository -- named *AChatt10*. 
In this repository, you are likely to find files of fun personal projects that I worked on. Some of them may not be complete, but the purpose of these projects is self-education.

## Who am I?
I am a Master of Professional Studies student in Applied Statistics at **Cornell University**. I have completed a Bachelor of Science degree from Cornell as well, with a major in *Biometry and Statistics* and a minor in *Computer Science*.

## What kind of files will be here?
Since I am a statistics student, many of these files will be regarding data analysis and machine learning. Hence, the most popular coding languages you'd find here are mostly in *R* but may also be in *Python*.

Many of the *R* files will be as an *R Markdown* file. 
*R Markdown* is a very clean and elegant way of presenting *R* code alongside text, so it makes sense to make full use of it.

## Concluding words

Please feel free to look around. 
Some projects may not be finished, but nothing present in this repository has not been given a sincere effort.
