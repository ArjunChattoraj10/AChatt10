This program is made with **Python 3.6.1**

This is a playlist chooser.

Choices are tough, so I made a program that contains the names of all my playlists, so that the computer can make the choice for me.

There is also an option called *other*. If the computer randomly chooses other, it then chooses among those.
*Other* choices include either a specific artist, or a playlist of a bunch of artists. 
However, these playlists are randomly put together and are not meant to be played in order, but rather shuffled.
